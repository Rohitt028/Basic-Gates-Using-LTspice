# Basic-Gates-Using-LTspice
# Design Files

- The `Design/` folder contains **screenshots of LTSpice schematics** for all basic logic gates.  
- Each image shows the CMOS-based circuit implementation of the gate.  
- These screenshots can be used as a reference to redraw the circuits in LTSpice if needed.  
- Default supply voltage: **(5V)**.

## ðŸ“Š Simulation

- The `Simulation/` folder contains **waveform screenshots (.png)** from LTSpice transient analysis.  
- Each waveform verifies the **truth table** of the corresponding logic gate.  
- Input signals are generated using pulse sources, and outputs are observed to confirm correct functionality.
